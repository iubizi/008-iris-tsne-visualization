008 iris tsne visualization

tsne is a dimensionality reduction method suitable for visualization. The calculation amount is much larger than that of pca, but the effect is very good (different classes can be clearly distinguished). tsne is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction method, which is nonlinear, so it should not be used with machine learning or deep learning.

In the iris data, the effect of tsne is comparable to pca, because this data set is too simple.
